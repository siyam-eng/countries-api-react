## My process

### Built with

- React + Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- REST Countries API

### What I learned

1. Routing with react router - I've implemented routing for the first time in any personal project with React.
2. Adding dark mode toggling with Tailwind
3. Calling APIs from react with useEffect and also making custom hooks for the API calls
4. Improved state management skills

Overall, I enjoyed a lot while building the project apart from learning all these new skills. It's an amazing project to practice front end!
